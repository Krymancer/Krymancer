## 🤔 Who am I?

Hi, I'm a crazy brazilian guy who loves to code and make cool stuff

## 🧐 What do I do?

So I started learning about programming in 2014, and sice then when I have an Idea I try to make it, or at least have fun trying

I like to make things from scratch, understand how things work and try to make them better

## 🤓 My "stack"

- **#️⃣ C#/dotnet** Love this language and the ecosystem. Used for a long time in bigge backend projets and professionally.

- **🕸️ Javascript** Who doesn't heard of it? For better or for worse I had to use a lot. Currently I'm using a lot of NextJS and React, but I really like SolidJS.

- **⚡ Zig** It's almost better than C.
 
- **🤖 C/C++** Been using C and C++ for learning data structures and in competitive programming since I started learn programing

- **🦀 Rust** The most blazinly fast language, if you don't if you have skill issues

- **🐍 Python** Use it mostly for IA and ML stuff

- **⚙️ Ocaml* Really like functional programing, ocaml is great
